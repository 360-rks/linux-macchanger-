# linux-macchanger-
 When you try to change your mac address in linux it changes temporarily.
 The temporarily mac address source will be unknown.
 So ,anybody trying to trace  you will easily know that it is a fault,
 and also when you poweroff the machine it automatically reset to deafault ones.
 I have attached a text file you can refer that an change you mac address of your kali machine.
 Run the following commands in your kali machine.
 The mac address will change and any body trying to trace will always be in doubt.
Note if any command is not working then apply sudo before the command
